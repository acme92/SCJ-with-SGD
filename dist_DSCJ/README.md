### Overview

SCJTDFD is a program that implements genome rearrangement algorithms in the directed Single Cut or Join with Tandem Duplications and Floating Duplications (SCJTDFD) model. This model and the related algorithms are described in the paper "A tractable variant of the Single Cut or Join distance with duplicated genes" published in the proceedings of [RECOMB-CG 2017](http://www.crg.eu/en/event/15th-recomb-comparative-genomics-satellite-workshop), Lecture Notes in Boinformatics (LNBI), volume 10562, Springer (DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-67979-2).

It is implements three algorithms:
* Computing the directed SCJTDFD distance between an ancestral genome A and a descendant genome D.
* Computing a parsimonious directed SCJTDFD scenario between an ancestral genome A and a descendant genome D.
* Computing a parsimonious directed median genome A of k descendant genomes D1, ..., Dk.

### Requirements

The code is composed of a set of Python scripts. It requires the following to be available:

* python (3)
* networkx library, which is available at: https://networkx.github.io/

### Usage

Use the following command to run the script:

python DSCJ.py -s/-m/-d <inputfile> <outputfile>

Use -d for computing the dSCJTDFD distance between the two input genomes
    -s for computing a parsimonious dSCJTDFD scenario between the two input genomes
    -m for computing a parsimonious dSCJTDFD median of k genomes
    
The input file should have the following format.
1. Each genome should start with the genome name followed by the genome itself in the next non-empty and non-commented line.
2. Each line that is read contains exactly one chromosome.
3. Linear chromosomes should end with '|' while circular chromosomes with ')'. 
4. Any gene in reverse orientation should be preceded by a '-' sign.
5. Lines containing the genome name should not end with '|' or ')'.
6. Any line that is a comment should start with a '#'. 
7. For -d and -s, the input file should contain exactly two genomes, both having the same set of gene families.
8. For -m, the input file should have at least two genomes and all genomes should have the same set of gene families.

Example:
Genome 1:
Chr1_name a -b c |
Chr2_name -d e f g )

Genome 2:
Chr1_name a -b c d )
Chr2_name e -f g |

### Examples
The directory test contains a small example. The resuls files have been obtained by the commands
python src/DSCJ.py -s test/input test/output_scenario
python src/DSCJ.py -d test/input test/output_distance

###Output file format
Every implementation (-d/-s/-m) of DSCJ.py yields two files - a log file and an output file.
The output files contain the following information:

* Distance (-d):
- 	The SCJTDFD distance and a breakdown of events (SCJ, TD, FD, tandem arrays and single gene circular chromosomes)
- 	Two lists of adjacencies, Cuts and Joins. Every element of the list is of the format: 
	[('gene1_name','extremity'),('gene2_name','extremity')], where extremity = 'h' or 't'.

* Scenario (-s):
-	The SCJTDFD distance and a breakdown of events (SCJ, TD, FD, tandem arrays and single gene circular chromosomes)
-	Two lists of genes, Floating Duplications and Tandem Duplications. Every gene in the list has a copy number associated with it.
	For instance, the 3rd copy of gene 'a' seen in D will be named as 'acopy3'. This is done to differentiate genes from the same family.
- 	Two lists of adjacencies, Cuts and Joins. Every element of the list is of the format: 
	[('gene1_name','extremity'),('gene2_name','extremity')], where extremity = 'h' or 't'.

* Median (-m):
-	List of adjacencies retained in the median genome.
	(('gene1_name','extremity'),('gene2_name','extremity')), where extremity = 'h' or 't'.
-	Score of the median genome.
